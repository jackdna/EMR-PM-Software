<h2>Error while saving image.</h2>

<p>An error occur while saving the image. Probably you are trying
to use the editor within an unlicensed domain name.</p>

<p><ul>
<li><a href="http://izhuk.com/painter/download.php" target="_blank">Get free evaluation license online</a><br>
or</li>
<li><a href="http://izhuk.com/painter/purchase.php" target="_blank" >Purchase a permanent license</a></li>
</ul></p>

<p>If you have obtained a license code and inserted it to the file "license.txt"
please examine the following reasons:

<pre>
1. The host (domain name or IP) used to access the applet's page doesn't correspond
   the license code, for example: the license was obtained for the domain "abc.com",
   but you try to open the editor's page using hosts like: xyz.com, or 192.170.16.1, etc..
       
2. The applet uses an old copy of the "license.txt":

   a). If you opened the applet's page in your browser and then updated the
       "license.txt" afterwards, you should close all the browser's windows
       to clean up the browser's cache. Then open the applet's page again.

   b). If you edited "license.txt" with a text editor which doesn't update
       file's date/time your web server doesn't load the updated "license.txt"
       but retrieves it's old copy from the server's cache.

3. "license.txt" is not accessible to the applet, for example:

    a. It is not located in the directory where "painter.jar" is.
    
    b. "license.txt" has some restricted access permissions
       so the applet can't retrieve it from the server.

4. You try to access the applet's page via a proxy server
   (for example via a firewall) that substitues domain names,
   but your browser is not configured for that.
