<p><u>My treatment with SURGERY has been personally described to me by&nbsp; {Surgeon Name</u>}</p>
<p>The following points of information, among others, have been specifically discussed and made clear and I have had the opportunity to ask any questions concerning this information:</p>
<p>I,<b>Kathryn</b> <b></b> <b>Strittmatter</b>(patient's name) understand that SURGERY is used to treat certain types of patients with Parkinson's disease and my physician has told me that I am this type of patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that there is a serious risk that I could develop severe liver failure, which may be potentially fatal, by using SURGERY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that there are no laboratory tests that will predict if I am at an increased risk for fatal liver failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that I should have the recommended blood work before my treatment with SURGERY is begun and periodically for the first 6 months of therapy.&nbsp; After the first six months, periodic monitoring should occur as directed by your physician. I understand that if the dose of SURGERY is increased, I should have the blood work take place before increasing the dose and have the blood work repeated periodically as described above. I understand that although this blood work may help detect if I develop liver failure it may do so only after significant, irreversible and potentially fatal damage has already occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
