This folder contains a java demo you can run, an INI file, an SO file, and a JAR. The SigPlus.ini is set up for a 1X5-size pad, so you'll want to open the SigPlus.ini file and change the TabletModel parameter to match your pad. Be  ure to use the included SigPlusSimpleDemo to start. This will allow you to use HSB pads under Java running Linux.
