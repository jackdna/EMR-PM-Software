1.
In global file set variable "API_CUSTOMER_ID" and "API_SECRET_KEY" as below:
If API id is not provided by customer then give value "0".
define('API_CUSTOMER_ID', '0');

For secret key provide servername to md5 function as given below:

This value will be unique for every server.

define('API_SECRET_KEY', md5('Global Eye Care Services'));


2.
The above same md5 created key will provided in below given file
Open file  "\R6-Dev\imw_api\API_imwemr\imedicware_api.php"
and set same md5 value to variable $SECRET_KEY

3.
In same file "\R6-Dev\imw_api\API_imwemr\imedicware_api.php" provide URL to server url to "SERVER_HOST" as given below:

This is the URL of server with which intergration has to set.

const SERVER_HOST = 'imw.servername.net/nse/imwemr/imw_api/receive_calls/index.php?mode=';

In above line part of url "/imw_api/receive_calls/index.php?mode=" will remain same for every server and only party before it will change depend on server name.

Directory "imwemr/imw_api/API_imwemr" is made for MD Prospectes and it will provided to them after done above settings.

OR

If not privding directory then after finish of 1st step provide below 5 credentials to customer.

User Key: MDprospectsAPIclient
User Agent: iMedicWareApiclient

SECRET_KEY="8ad1a16367f3ca8830b6ef7c964f839c"; (This is MD5 value created in first step)

SERVER_HOST = 'imw.servername.net/nse/imwemr/imw_api/receive_calls/index.php?mode=';

sec_code is MD5 value made by below logic:
sec_code= MD5(User Key.User Agent.Secret Key);
sec_code="2be22a47f3f991af973efa7db776394d"  Send this code to customer.
