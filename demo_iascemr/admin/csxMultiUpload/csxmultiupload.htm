<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
<!--
// Notes
// The Class ID in the OBJECT tag calls up the full version of csXMultiUpload.
// A different Class ID is used from the trial version.
// On a working web site the OCX or CAB file must be sent to the client by using the CODEBASE attribute
// This example will work on a machine that has had the OCX installed with our installer but on public web site 
// the Microsoft LPK File Generation Tool should be used to package the licence file so that clients 
// can use the control without their own licence.
// See the instructions for more details.
// The code needed to use the LPK file is shown but the file needs to be created on the server.

// This example shows the RemoteURL property being set using a PARAM tag.
// This must be set to a valid URL before running this example.
// An event handler is defined for the onStartFile event and this is used
// to add a form variable to the last upload in the batch.
